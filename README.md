# GraciePost
A tool I made to let me post artwork to Discord right from my browser. My Discord bot keeps an updated json file with all the channels in my server and their respective IDs, and GraciePost fetches this to create a context menu for images. GraciePost will send json data back to my bot with not only the image url, but also metadata that it picked up from the page like an artist's name or the title of the work, etc.
