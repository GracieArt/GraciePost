# GraciePost
A tool I made to let me post artwork to Discord right from my browser. When the extension loads, it will query my server for the list of channels that my Discord bot is in. It then uses that to create a context menu for images where u can pick what channel to send the artwork. When you click an option, GraciePost will send json data back to my bot with not only the image url, but also metadata that it picked up from the page like an artist's name or the title of the work, etc.

The icon was designed by [Sasha Koshka](https://github.com/sashakoshka)
